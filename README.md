##Auto-Emaily
This is a feedback collection website that allows users to sign in with their google account, purchase credits, create simple yes/no question, and send to a list of surveyees. Once the surveyees click either yes or no within their email, the dashboard page of the logged in user can see the updated statistics.

This is a mern stack project ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)). The credit card payment (currently in test mode, so no real credit card is required) is processed by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) and the emails are sent by [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/).
